## 1. The Anatomy of Object Creation in Pure Dart

At its simplest, Dart is an object-oriented language with class-based inheritance and mixin-based composition. When building a small script or a single-screen prototype, instantiating dependencies directly inside a class feels natural:

```dart
class OrderService {
  final ApiClient _apiClient = ApiClient();
  final LocalDatabase _database = LocalDatabase();

  Future<void> checkout(Order order) async {
    await _apiClient.submitOrder(order);
    await _database.saveOrderHistory(order);
  }
}
```

While this code runs, it hides a fundamental architectural flaw: **tight coupling**.

- **Hidden dependencies** — looking at the constructor `OrderService()`, nothing indicates that it requires an active network client and a local database instance.
- **Rigid implementation** — `OrderService` cannot be reused with an authenticated API client, a cached database variant, or a staging endpoint.
- **Zero testability** — testing `checkout()` requires a live network connection and an actual database file, because the dependencies cannot be replaced from the outside.

## 2. Manual Dependency Injection: Pure Dart at Work

Dependency Injection is not a library or a framework; it is a design pattern rooted in the **Inversion of Control (IoC)** principle. In pure Dart, Dependency Injection requires no packages—only interfaces, constructor parameters, and a composition root.

### Step 1: Program to abstractions

In pure Dart, every class implicitly defines an interface. You can define abstract contracts in your domain layer:

```dart
abstract class ApiClient {
  Future<void> submitOrder(Order order);
}

abstract class LocalDatabase {
  Future<void> saveOrderHistory(Order order);
}
```

### Step 2: Inject dependencies via constructor

Instead of creating its own dependencies, `OrderService` asks for them explicitly through its constructor:

```dart
class OrderService {
  final ApiClient _apiClient;
  final LocalDatabase _database;

  OrderService({
    required ApiClient apiClient,
    required LocalDatabase database,
  })  : _apiClient = apiClient,
        _database = database;

  Future<void> checkout(Order order) async {
    await _apiClient.submitOrder(order);
    await _database.saveOrderHistory(order);
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Pure Dart unit testing

Because dependencies are supplied through the constructor, writing isolated unit tests requires zero special tooling or reflection:

```dart
class FakeApiClient implements ApiClient {
  bool orderSubmitted = false;

  @override
  Future<void> submitOrder(Order order) async {
    orderSubmitted = true;
  }
}

class FakeDatabase implements LocalDatabase {
  @override
  Future<void> saveOrderHistory(Order order) async {}
}

void main() {
  test('OrderService submits order via ApiClient', () async {
    final fakeApi = FakeApiClient();
    final fakeDb = FakeDatabase();
    final orderService = OrderService(apiClient: fakeApi, database: fakeDb);

    await orderService.checkout(Order(id: '101'));

    expect(fakeApi.orderSubmitted, isTrue);
  });
}
```

### Step 4: The Composition Root

In a pure manual Dependency Injection approach, all instances are instantiated and wired together at the application entry point (the **Composition Root**):

```dart
void main() {
  final apiClient = HttpApiClient(baseUrl: 'https://api.enterprise.com');
  final database = SqliteDatabase(path: '/data/app.db');
  final orderService = OrderService(apiClient: apiClient, database: database);

  runApp(MyApp(orderService: orderService));
}
```

## 3. The Breaking Point of Manual Dependency Injection at Enterprise Scale

Manual Dependency Injection works cleanly for smaller apps. However, as an enterprise application grows to dozens of engineers, hundreds of services, and multiple feature modules, manual dependency wiring begins to break down:

- **Constructor parameter drilling** — passing dependencies through five or six layers of constructors creates boilerplate and bloats intermediate classes that have no interest in those dependencies.
- **Complex lifecycle management** — manually coordinating lazy singletons, factory instances, asynchronous initializations, and disposal logic leads to fragile, order-dependent startup scripts.
- **Multi-environment branching** — switching between `dev`, `staging`, and `prod` configurations results in sprawling manual factories with tangled `switch` or `if` statements.
- **Monorepo bottlenecks and merge conflicts** — when 30 developers across multiple feature teams edit the same central `composition_root.dart` file every sprint, merge conflicts and race conditions become routine.

## 4. Introducing Injectify: Automating Dependency Injection

This is where **Injectify** enters the picture. Injectify combines the speed and simplicity of the `get_it` service locator with the safety of **compile-time code generation**.

Instead of writing and maintaining hundreds of lines of imperative wiring code, you annotate your pure Dart classes. Injectify reads these annotations and generates a type-safe, ordered dependency registry.

### Basic registration with annotations

To register a class, annotate it with `@Injectable()`:

```dart
// Concrete implementation bound to its abstract interface
@Injectable(as: ApiClient, scope: Scope.lazySingleton)
class HttpApiClient implements ApiClient {
  final HttpClientConfig config;

  HttpApiClient(this.config);

  @override
  Future<void> submitOrder(Order order) async {
    // Network implementation
  }
}
```

### Initializing the container

In your root application setup, declare an `@InjectableInit` annotation:

```dart
import 'package:get_it/get_it.dart';
import 'package:injectify/injectify.dart';

import 'injection.config.dart';

final getIt = GetIt.instance;

@InjectableInit()
void configureDependencies({String? environment}) =>
    getIt.init(environment: environment);
```

When you run `dart run build_runner build`, Injectify inspects the constructor parameters of all annotated classes, orders registrations by `@Order` priority, and writes the generated registration code:

```dart
// Generated code (injection.config.dart)
extension GetItInjectableX on _i1.GetIt {
  _i1.GetIt init({String? environment, _i2.EnvironmentFilter? environmentFilter}) {
    final gh = _i2.GetItHelper(this, environment: environment, environmentFilter: environmentFilter);
    gh.lazySingleton<_i3.HttpClientConfig>(() => _i3.HttpClientConfig());
    gh.lazySingleton<_i4.ApiClient>(() => _i4.HttpApiClient(gh<_i3.HttpClientConfig>()));
    gh.factory<_i5.OrderService>(() => _i5.OrderService(
      apiClient: gh<_i4.ApiClient>(),
      database: gh<_i6.LocalDatabase>(),
    ));
    return this;
  }
}
```

## 5. Enterprise-Grade Capabilities

Injectify provides purpose-built tools designed to address the specific architectural challenges of large-scale Dart and Flutter applications.

### Multi-environment gating

Enterprise apps routinely operate across Development, Staging, and Production environments. Injectify allows you to bind different implementations to the same contract based on the active environment tag:

```dart
@Environment('dev')
@Environment('test')
@Injectable(as: ApiClient, scope: Scope.lazySingleton)
class MockApiClient implements ApiClient {
  @override
  Future<void> submitOrder(Order order) async {
    // Returns instant simulated response
  }
}

@Environment('prod')
@Injectable(as: ApiClient, scope: Scope.lazySingleton)
class LiveApiClient implements ApiClient {
  final Dio _dio;
  LiveApiClient(this._dio);

  @override
  Future<void> submitOrder(Order order) async {
    // Real network call
  }
}
```

At startup, switching environments requires only passing the environment string:

```dart
void main() {
  configureDependencies(environment: Environment.prod);
  runApp(const MyApp());
}
```

### Third-party SDK integration with external modules

Enterprise applications rely heavily on external SDKs (such as `SharedPreferences`, `Dio`, or Firebase clients) whose source code cannot be annotated directly. Use `@ExternalModule` to declare providers for external instances:

```dart
@ExternalModule()
abstract class CoreModule {
  @Injectable(scope: Scope.lazySingleton)
  Dio get dio => Dio(BaseOptions(baseUrl: 'https://api.enterprise.com'));

  @Injectable(scope: Scope.singleton)
  @PreResolve
  Future<SharedPreferences> get prefs => SharedPreferences.getInstance();
}
```

The `@PreResolve` annotation flags `SharedPreferences` as an asynchronous singleton. The generator emits `await gh.singletonAsync<SharedPreferences>(() => coreModule.prefs)`, registering the dependency as pending inside the container. The future itself completes when the app calls `await getIt.allReady()` (or `getIt.getAsync<T>()`) — before that, synchronous `getIt<SharedPreferences>()` throws.

### Micro-packages for modular monorepos

Large enterprise applications scale horizontally by separating features into independent Dart packages (`core_network`, `feature_auth`, `feature_billing`).

Injectify supports **Micro-Packages**, allowing each feature package to maintain its own independent dependency graph:

```dart
// Inside packages/feature_billing/lib/billing_module.dart
import 'package:injectify/injectify.dart';

@InjectableMicroPackage(moduleName: 'Billing')
void configureBillingPackage() {}
```

Running `build_runner` inside `packages/feature_billing` generates `BillingInjectableModule` in `billing_module.config.dart`.

The root application then composes all feature micro-packages declaratively using `ExternalMicroPackage`:

```dart
// Inside apps/main_app/lib/di/injection.dart
import 'package:get_it/get_it.dart';
import 'package:injectify/injectify.dart';

// Import generated module configs from external packages
import 'package:feature_auth/auth_module.config.dart';
import 'package:feature_billing/billing_module.config.dart';

import 'injection.config.dart';

final getIt = GetIt.instance;

@InjectableInit(
  externalMicroPackages: [
    ExternalMicroPackage(AuthInjectableModule),
    ExternalMicroPackage(BillingInjectableModule),
  ],
)
void configureDependencies(String environment) => getIt.init(environment: environment);
```

During application generation, Injectify writes:

```dart
// Generated code (injection.config.dart)
gh.initMicroPackage(_i3.AuthInjectableModule());
gh.initMicroPackage(_i4.BillingInjectableModule());
```

This architecture ensures feature teams work independently in their own packages without merge conflicts or knowledge of other feature internals.

## 6. Architectural Best Practices

To get the most out of Dependency Injection with Injectify in enterprise Flutter projects:

- **Keep classes pure with constructor injection** — write standard Dart classes that receive dependencies through constructors; do not invoke `getIt<T>()` inside business logic methods.
- **Let the framework wire the composition root** — let code generation handle the assembly of the graph, avoiding runtime errors and reflection overhead.
- **Separate domain contracts from infrastructure** — place interfaces and use cases in pure Dart packages with no Flutter dependencies, and provide concrete adapters in infrastructure packages.
- **Keep presentation layers decoupled** — inject Blocs, Cubits, or ViewModels into your UI layer via Flutter's `InheritedWidget` system (such as `BlocProvider`), keeping widgets independent of the underlying Dependency Injection container.

## 7. Summary

Dependency Injection begins as a foundational Dart design pattern: programming to abstractions and passing dependencies explicitly through constructors. As applications scale to enterprise proportions, manual Dependency Injection becomes cumbersome to maintain.

**Injectify** bridges the gap between clean object-oriented architecture and enterprise development velocity, delivering automated registration, compile-time safety, environment switching, and modular micro-package support.
