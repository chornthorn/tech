  Instance lifetimes in Injectify: Factory, Singleton, and Lazy Singleton.
---

In Injectify, the lifecycle of a dependency is controlled by the `Scope` enumeration.

---

## 1. Supported Lifecycles

Injectify supports **three** lifecycles, each mapped to a corresponding GetIt registration method:

- **Factory** — `Scope.factory` (default) — A new instance is created on _every lookup_ (`getIt<T>()`). This maps to GetIt's `registerFactory`.
- **Lazy Singleton** — `Scope.lazySingleton` — A single shared instance is created _on first lookup_ and cached for subsequent lookups. This maps to GetIt's `registerLazySingleton`.
- **Eager Singleton** — `Scope.singleton` — A single shared instance is created _immediately_ at `init()` time. This maps to GetIt's `registerSingleton`.

---

## 2. Defining Lifecycles

### Factory (Default)

```dart
import 'package:injectify/injectify.dart';

// Omitting the scope parameter defaults to Scope.factory
@Injectable()
class SearchBloc {
  final ApiClient client;
  SearchBloc(this.client);
}
```

Generated code:

```dart
gh.factory<SearchBloc>(() => SearchBloc(gh<ApiClient>()));
```

---

### Lazy Singleton

Recommended for stateless services, repositories, and API clients that should only be created if needed.

```dart
@Injectable(scope: Scope.lazySingleton)
class AnalyticsTracker {
  // Initialized only when first requested
}
```

Generated code:

```dart
gh.lazySingleton<AnalyticsTracker>(() => AnalyticsTracker());
```

---

### Eager Singleton

Useful for services that perform background monitoring, cache pre-warming, or must be instantiated immediately during app initialization.

```dart
@Injectable(scope: Scope.singleton)
class PushNotificationManager {
  PushNotificationManager() {
    _startListening();
  }
  void _startListening() {}
}
```

Generated code:

```dart
gh.singleton<PushNotificationManager>(PushNotificationManager());
```

---

## 3. Binding to an Interface / Abstract Type

To register an implementation under an interface or abstract base class type, use the `as:` parameter:

```dart
abstract class AuthRepository {
  Future<void> login(String username, String password);
}

@Injectable(as: AuthRepository, scope: Scope.lazySingleton)
class AuthRepositoryImpl implements AuthRepository {
  @override
  Future<void> login(String username, String password) async {}
}
```

Generated registration:

```dart
gh.lazySingleton<AuthRepository>(() => AuthRepositoryImpl());
```

Clients resolve the dependency via the interface type:

```dart
final auth = getIt<AuthRepository>(); // Resolves AuthRepositoryImpl
```
